Project Topic: Design and Manipulation for Slave Robot
• Developed space control framework codes for torque distribution, joint elasticity, trajectory tracking
control in slave robot using inverse dynamics and QP optimization algorithm
• Programmed cartesian control of one arm 7 DOF manipulators based on impedance control theory
under gravity
Project Topic: Design and Manipulation for Master System
• Led initial development of integrated master system of HMD, Exosuit, Haptic Gloves
• Defined conversion matrix to extract joint trajectories from Kinect data and transport to manipulation
actuators in slave robot
• Determined the threshold of latency by comparing physical and extrapolated marker for estimation of
teleoperation performance
• Developed virtual space environment to test control of teleoperated robot hands using Unity
