Under guidance of Prof. Kyujin Cho, we designed wearable master system to provide proper feedback when the robot interacts with the surrounding environment. I proposed advanced master system including a real-time feedback control with integration of trajectory tracking, sensor fusion, and soft robotics. 

With [Chris Atkeson](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~cga/) and Alex Spitzer. Using optimizers to match an observed trajectory.
