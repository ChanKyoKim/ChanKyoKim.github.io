We introduce a yaw-equivariannt Network-Coupled Inertial Odemetry with creating fully SO(3) equivariant neural networks from conventional neural networks. Through the equivariant network, we get better generalization of displacement estimation without considering distribution of IMU measurement data, any other augmentations in data and architecture.
